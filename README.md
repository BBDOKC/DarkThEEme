### Overview
This is a basic syntax highlighter for ExpressionEngine code built specifically for [Prism.js](http://prismjs.com).

### Installation
Copy the lang.ee.js file and include it in the Prism.js file, or include it seperately in your document's head. To get syntax highlighting to work, simply create an element as follows:

	<pre class="language-ee"><code>
		// Your code goes here
	</code></pre>
